Foodsoft
=========

This is a fork of [Foodsoft](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft) with adaptions for some foodcoops in Switzerland, especially for [Foodcoop-Comedor](http://foodcoop-comedor.ch/).

A food cooperative is a group of people that buy food from suppliers of their own choosing. A collective do-it-yourself supermarket. Members  order their products online and collect them on a specified day. And all put in a bit of work to make that possible. Foodsoft facilitates the process.
